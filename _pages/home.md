### Welcome!

I am a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Kansas in Dr. Maggie Wagner’s lab. My research investigates the mechanisms by which plants tolerate flooding. While water is essential for plants, too much of it can have dramatic consequences. When plants are flooded, their roots quickly deplete available oxygen, leading to oxygen starvation, the buildup of stress compounds, and ultimately plant death. This stress can fundamentally alter roots at the anatomical level, and these microscopic changes in turn reshape the root habitat occupied by microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses. My work aims to explore links between plant genetics, root anatomy, and the microbiome to better understand their combined effects on plant flood responses.
