<h4>Microbiomes under stress</h4>
I lead collaborative research investigating how microbial communities influence drought and flood tolerance in maize. As part of this work, I have helped develop a maize culture collection, deposited in a globally accessible strain repository, that enables the construction of synthetic communities to dissect microbial interactions and their effects on community function and host health under drought stress. I am also investigating how plants and their microbiomes cope with waterlogging, a stress that is understudied but increasing in frequency and severity with global climate change. With this research I am using a comparative system with maize and its closest temperate relative, Tripsacum dactyloides which differ in key root anatomical traits. This interdisciplinary research integrates plant genetics, physiology, and microbiology, opening numerous avenues for exploring and predicting the impacts of plant-microbe interactions across various plant species.

<h4>Grapevine microbiomes</h4>
Grafting is a horticultural technique that joins different plant organs to form a vascular connection, bringing together microbial communities from distinct genotypes within a single plant. I study how root and shoot system genotypes influence the microbiome of grapevines (Vitis vinifera). This research has taken me from Southwest Missouri to California’s Central Valley, where I leverage both experimental and commercial vineyards to address these questions.

<h4>Mammalian DNA Metabarcoding</h4>
Assessing mammalian species without inducing stress or human influence is a challenging goal. I have collaborated with Dr. Richard Lance and colleagues at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Environmental Laboratory to validate new non-invasive approaches for studying bat populations. Using multifaceted DNA metabarcoding (MDM), we simultaneously collected multiple parameters within bat populations to better inform conservation practices. This workflow was optimized for both nectar-feeding and insectivorous bat species within multispecies colonies.

I have also collaborated with Dr. Matthew Kolp (Lincoln Memorial University) on bioinformatic analyses of canine fecal microbiome samples, investigating the prevalence and impact of gastrointestinal parasitic helminths in rural and urban environments. Additionally, we are currently working to validate a hybrid-capture strategy to simultaneously assess tick-borne pathogens and the mammalian host blood meal in Ixodid ticks.

<h4>Population Genetics</h4>
As a research technician in Dr. Christy Edwards’ lab at the Missouri Botanical Garden, 
I investigated how life history traits and human activities influence genetic diversity 
and population structure in rare, threatened, and endangered plant species. My work involved 
developing and applying microsatellite and next-generation sequencing approaches to characterize 
patterns of genetic variation across a wide range of taxa, contributing to conservation strategies 
for at-risk plants.
